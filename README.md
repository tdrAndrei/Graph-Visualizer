## Create and View any graphs
Input your graph in the editor using the edge list format (vertex-vertex pairs on each row)

## Test out algorithms
After you've created your graph you can use the command prompt on the left side to run algorithms on your graph. Find the shortest path between any vertexes or the maximal coupling in a bipartite graph.

## How to use it
```
git clone https://github.com/tdrAndrei/Graph-Visualizer.git
```
After that go into the ``Graph-Visualizer`` folder and double click on ``index.html`` to open the app in browser.
